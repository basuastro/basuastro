HELLO!!


I’m Arghyadeep (“Or-Gho-deep”) Basu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon (CRAL), working in the FIRSTGAL team on “Unveiling the hidden population of galaxies from Cosmic Dawn to Cosmic Reionization.”

Before moving to Lyon, I completed my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (MPA) in Garching — about 40 minutes from the heart of Munich — where I spent my days as a sort of cosmic detective, tracing how the first galaxies and quasars transformed the early Universe. I spent few months as a postdoctoral researcher as well. Working in the group of Dr. Benedetta Ciardi, my research focused on the Epoch of Reionization, exploring how different sources of ionizing radiation shaped the intergalactic medium (from hydrogen to helium reionization).

I also investigated how stellar feedback affects the variability of the high-redshift UV luminosity function using SPICE, a high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic cosmological simulation suite with diverse supernova feedback models — and yes, I do enjoy “playing” with it!

Before diving into cosmology, I was just a regular physics enthusiast from Presidency University, Kolkata, with a telescope, a sky full of curiosity, and a growing fascination for how the first cosmic structures came to be.
