The **SPICE** (Simulated Photons in Cosmological Environments) suite is a set of very high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic simulations run with **RAMSES**, designed to capture the effects of different **supernova feedback models** and source variability during the Epoch of Reionization.

Our recent work investigates the **variability of the UV luminosity function** (UVLF) predicted by SPICE compared to JWST observations. We find that bursty feedback and intermittent star formation can naturally reproduce the scatter observed in early JWST UVLFs.
